# pyFatturaPA
Tool for quick, command-line generation of simple e-Invoice compatible with the Italian-standard, [FatturaPA](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it).

This is a typical, lazy sunday afternoon exercise, aimed at self-generating e-invoices to private companies as an individual freelance consultant.
It is a rudimetary command-line generator of XML e-invoices to be later electronically signed or sealed. It generates a JSON database of clients (with VAT# and full invoicing information). More and more complex invoicing scenarios will be added in future releases.
Due to the validity of such e-invoicing standard being limited to the Italian territory, next description is in Italian language only.

A pre-compiled version for Windows (from the original Python 3 sources) will be also available.
